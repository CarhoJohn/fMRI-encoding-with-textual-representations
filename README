fMRI Encoding with Textual Representations
This is a tutorial for the Neuroimaging Methods Workshop given by Shaonan Wang. Special thanks to Xiaohan Zhang for proving the raw code in which part of the code is from https://github.com/HuthLab/speechmodeltutorial. If you use the code, please cite:

In this tutorial you will step through a voxel-wise modeling analysis, which uses textual representations to predict brain activations. The higher the predictation score, the more information of the textual representations (semantics&syntax) is encoded in the brain.

Here we provide some fMRI sample dataset ("story_1.mat, story_2.mat, ..., story_10.mat") and aligned textual representations ("story_1_word2vec_convolved.mat") which can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z52lkYqAXHLV4qenfFUE5yetlgsvdX_3?usp=share_link.

We also provide two scripts: "hrf.py" and "load_nii.py" which can transform the raw data from https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004078 to the format used in the this tutorial.
